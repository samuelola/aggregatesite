D-aggregate Tech metamophorsized from 20years experienced visionary leader who believe data is the future of the world. 
He believes data will be the most critical factor for every company's growth across the world. 
We started our data aggregation journey in 2017 as a department in the group company - Hazonholdings (
We delivered 120,000 outlets monitoring and data capture for Nestle Nigeria, 10,000 retail audit for Suntory Beverages. In 2018, we got a brief to partner 
with Bank of Industry Nigeria to deliver data capture of 2million informal traders in Nigeria. Also, during covid-19, 
we got another recommendation from Federal Ministry and Trade and Investment Nigeria(SMEDAN sections) to aggregate 500,000 data records of MSMEs in Nigeria. 
While delivering these projects, we developed advanced tools to gather data at any scale with highest commitment from our team of data and IT experts.
Ultmately, we birthed D-Aggregate Tech in 2022 as the data aggregation platform for on-ground market data that drives informed decision and improve productivity.
